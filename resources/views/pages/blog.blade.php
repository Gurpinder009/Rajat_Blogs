                Hello everyone, in this blog, we will build three pc under the budget of 30k rupees.

                We are going for custom build this time just because prebuilds are not good and there you don’t have the
                option to choose the components and sometimes the performance of those components are poor. Also,
                prebuild
                components don’t offer you many upgradability options. In terms of custom builds, we have the
                independence
                to choose components and we also have better upgradability options. And we can build the pc at an
                affordable
                price.

                Here I’ve mentioned different builds:
